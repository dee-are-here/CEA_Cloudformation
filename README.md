This repository contains a collection of modular AWS CloudFormation templates designed to automate the deployment of foundational cloud infrastructure. Each YAML file defines a specific component within a scalable and secure AWS environment, including networking, compute, identity, and storage layers. The templates are structured to work independently or together as part of a complete infrastructure stack.

The VPC templates (vpc.yaml and vpc2.yaml) create a Virtual Private Cloud with subnets, route tables, and internet gateways, establishing the network foundation for the environment. The EC2 template (ec2.yaml) provisions virtual machines within the VPC and includes configurations for security groups and key pairs. The Auto Scaling Group template (asg.yaml) enables automatic scaling of EC2 instances to maintain performance and efficiency based on workload demand. The IAM templates (iam.yaml and iam_group.yaml) handle identity and access management by creating roles, policies, and groups with permissions based on the principle of least privilege. The S3 bucket templates (s3-bucket.yaml and s3-bucket2.yaml) provide object storage solutions with optional configurations such as encryption, versioning, and lifecycle rules.

Each template can be deployed individually through the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). To deploy through the console, simply open CloudFormation, select “Create Stack,” upload the YAML file, and follow the on-screen prompts. To deploy via the CLI, use the aws cloudformation create-stack command, specifying the stack name and template file path. When deploying multiple components, the recommended order is to start with the VPC templates, followed by IAM, then S3, and finally the EC2 and Auto Scaling Group templates.

These templates follow AWS best practices for CloudFormation, including modular design, parameterization, and consistent tagging. They are compatible with AWS CLI version 2 and support deployment across all AWS regions. Security considerations include applying least-privilege IAM policies, encrypting data at rest and in transit, blocking public S3 access unless explicitly required, and maintaining secure key management practices.
